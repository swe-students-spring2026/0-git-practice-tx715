## Why it's interesting

I found this article interesting because it explores how certain tech careers are less likely to be replaced by AI in the near future. As someone interested in software development for work, I thought it was valuable to reflect on which roles might remain essential even as AI becomes more capable. I should focus on AI-proofing my job even in the industry of SWE where AI is very dominant in. 

The article made me think about how software engineers will need to combine technical skills with creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving to stay competitive. It also broadened my perspective on career strategy in the tech industry- especially the importance of choosing roles that leverage human strengths where machines still struggle.

Comment from Alan(aw4630): I agree that there are definitely some tech careers that are less likely to be replaced by AI than others. Specifically, cybersecurity. As the barrier for software development has lowered and people increasingly code with agents, they understand less of what is being coded, and security vulnerabilities will arise. The need for security experts will stay the same if not increase.
