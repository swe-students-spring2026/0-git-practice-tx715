[10 High Paying Tech Jobs Safe From Artificial Intelligence](https://motionrecruitment.com/blog/10-high-paying-tech-jobs-safe-from-artificial-intelligence)

## Why it's interesting

I found this article interesting because it explores how certain tech careers are less likely to be replaced by AI in the near future. As someone interested in software development for work, I thought it was valuable to reflect on which roles might remain essential even as AI becomes more capable. I should focus on AI-proofing my job even in the industry of SWE where AI is very dominant in. 

The article made me think about how software engineers will need to combine technical skills with creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving to stay competitive. It also broadened my perspective on career strategy in the tech industry- especially the importance of choosing roles that leverage human strengths where machines still struggle.

## Comment (by Vick / Han Xiao)

I agree with the article’s main idea that some roles will stay valuable even as AI tools improve, but I think the key factor is not the job title — it’s the part of the workflow you own. If a role mostly involves repetitive implementation with clear specs, AI will likely automate more of it. But if the role involves defining the problem, making trade-offs (cost, reliability, security, UX), and coordinating with humans, it will stay “AI-resistant” longer.

This also makes me think my best strategy is to build skills that AI can’t easily replace: system design thinking, debugging real-world failures, communicating with stakeholders, and understanding product context. Even as an SWE, using AI effectively is important, but being able to evaluate AI output and make correct engineering decisions is what actually protects your value.
